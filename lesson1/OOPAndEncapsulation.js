What is object oriented programming?
  It's a programming paradigm in which problems are treated as objects. It uses Objects to organize a program.
  These objects have state (properties) and behavior (actions).
Advantages and disadvantges of OOP?
  Adv: It lets programmers think about a probelm at a higher level of abstraction, which helps in breaking down and solving the problem.
    OOP helps programmers write programs that reduce dependencins in a program, which makes maintenance easier. 
    Done right, OOP makes code flexible, easy to understand and each to change
  Disadv: Could require more computation power, could be slower, could take more disk space, more memoty.
  OOP programs are often much larged than the equivaled procedural program.
What is encapsulation in JS?
  Encapsulation is the idea of bundling data and operations associated with that data in a single entity.
  It relates properties and methods in a single object.
How does encapsulation defer in JS?
In other languages, encapsulation concerns hiding details of an object from code that uses the object. 
An object should only expose the methods and properties that other objects need to use the encapsulated 
object. However, JavaScript does not directly provide the means to limit exposure of methods and 
properties. There are ways to achieve a degree of access restriction, but they're not perfect.
